                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p> The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
        It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. 
        Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.</p>
     <p> The gemsbok is generally a grazer but changes to browsing during the dry season or when grass is sparse. 
        <p></p>   It may dig up to a meter deep to find roots and tubers, supplementing its water intake by eating wild tsama melons and cucumbers, which can provide all the water required (3 liters per 100 kg bodyweight and day).</p>
        The gemsbok is polygynous, with one resident male mating with the receptive females in the herd. 
        The male is known to secure exclusive mating access to the females by attempting to herd mixed or nursery herds onto his territory. The gemsbok has no specified breeding season, but the young in a given herd tend to be of a similar age due to reproductive synchrony between females. Pregnant females leave the herd before giving birth. The gestation period lasts 270 days and mothers give birth to 1-2 offspring. The calf remains hidden 6 weeks after birth, after which mother and calf rejoin the herd.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E23, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
